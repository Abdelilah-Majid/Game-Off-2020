# Contributing
Thanks for looking at my game! I appreciate it! It looks like you want to contribute if you are reading this file. But first there are a couple things you need to do!

## Fork the repo
In the top left of this repository click the `fork` button to create your own copy of this repository.

## Create your own branch
Once you have created your copy of this repository, go into your copy and change the branch from `main` to a different branch. You can call it whatever you please!

## Make some changes
Once you are on a new branch of your copied repository make some changes or additions to the code. Please don't add anything weird or anything that will not help me with this project.

## Pull request it
Once you have made the changes you want to see, submit a pull request onto my repository. When making the pull request your branch should be on the left with an arrow pointing back onto my original repository. My repository <---- Your repository/branch. Once you have submitted the Pull Request I will review it and if I like it I will merge it with the original repository!

### Thanks again for contributing and helping out! I really appreciate it!
