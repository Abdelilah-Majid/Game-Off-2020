      Welcome to the game I made with the help from a few other contributors. In this game you are acting as the space invader on the left of the game board. You are invading our moon. NASA and a few other space exploration teams have put together a space army. They are firing bullets at you that you must jump over. If one hits you you lose. Good Luck and have fun!

        How to play
      </h1>
      <p id="htp-instructions" class="text">The goal of the game is to jump over the bullets and gain points by doing so. You can do this a few ways.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Up Arrow - Pressing the up arrow will make you jump.</li>
        <li>Spacebar - Pressing the spacebar will also make you jump, this comes down to personal preference</li>
        <li>Jump Button - Clicking the button that says Jump will also make you jump. This is more for mobile players.</li>
        <li>Down Arrow - Pressing the down arrow will make you duck under the bullets when they are to high to jump over.</li>
        <li>Crouch Button - Pressing the button that says Crouch will also make you crouch under bullets. Works better for mobile players</li>
      </ol>
