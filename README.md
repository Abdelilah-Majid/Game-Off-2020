# Game-Off-2020
My attempt at the Game Off 2020 game jam hosted by GitHub and Lee Reilly. All my code for the jam will be hosted here!

# Live Version
[View the Live Game Here! It is still in BETA version and will be updated frequently!](https://landonlloyd.github.io/Game-Off-2020/)

# Instructions
The instructions for the game are quite simple: Don't get hit by the bullet that comes your way. You are acting as the randomly colored character on the left of the screen and you have to jump over the bullet using the UP arrow or the Spacebar to do so. 

# Contributing
I will gladly accept pull requests from anyone! I would really appreciate it actually! If you would like to contribute please read the [CONTRIBUTING.md file](https://github.com/LandonLloyd/Game-Off-2020/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) first. I would also love some feature requests for the game. Just open up a GitHub issue and I will take a look at it! Thanks!
