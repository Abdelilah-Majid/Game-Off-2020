# Game-Off-2020
My attempt at the Game Off 2020 game jam hosted by GitHub and Lee Reilly. All my code for the jam will be hosted here!

# Live Version
[View the Live Game Here! It is still in BETA version and will be updated frequently!](https://landonlloyd.github.io/Game-Off-2020/)

# Instructions
The instructions for the game are quite simple: Don't get hit by the blue bullet. You are acting as the red character and have to jump over the bullet using the UP arrow or the Spacebar to do so. 

# Contributing
I would gladly accept pull requests from anyone! I would really appreciate it actually! If you would like to contribute please read the [CONTRIBUTING.md file](https://github.com/LandonLloyd/Game-Off-2020/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) first. I would also love to get some feature requests for the game. Just open up a GitHub issue and I will take a look at it! Thanks!
